    <h5> Wayne States history began in 1868, when five physicians who witnessed the crude medical treatment on Civil War battlefields committed themselves to advancing health education and care in Detroit. They founded the Detroit Medical College, which has since transformed into Wayne State's School of Medicine.
Today, their main, 200-acre campus in Midtown Detroit is home to nearly 25,000 undergraduate and graduate students from across the United States and 70 countries. Wayne State University, along with the University of Michigan and Michigan State University, compose the University Research Corridor of Michigan. Wayne State is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities (Very high research activity)".</h5>
